LAN Sync over SSH

Sync and backup file from a host on the LAN over SSH
Setup:
	For setup of DNS and SSH, see the description website.

Usage:
	$ ./ssh_sync.sh hosts|dns <remote_src_path> <local_dest_path>

Example:
	$ ./ssh_sync.sh dns /Users/john/homework /Users/john/backup

	This sync the directory /Users/john/homework into 
	/Users/john/backup/homework

Diagnostics:
	If "The host may be down or not accessible at this time." message appears
	and the remote machine is actually up. If you know the IP address of the
	remote machine on the LAN, try the
	following command:

		$ ./ssh_sync.sh test <ip address>

		or:

		$ ping <ip address>

	Then execute the script again. The local ARP table should be updated.
